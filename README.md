## About the Video Course
The scope of computer vision has been booming in the past few years and it has become a highly sought-after skill. There are tons of real-life problems just waiting to be solved with computer vision. If you want to get your hands dirty with this technology and use it to craft your own, unique solutions, then look no further because this course is made for you! 
The course is designed so you’ll learn as you develop interesting apps. First you’ll learn to set up your environment, before building five exciting applications. We’ll introduce you to all necessary concepts and slowly transition into the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning such as classification and object detection. 
This course will not only help you use OpenCV 4 but also apply your computer vision and AI skills to your projects. All you need is a basic working knowledge of Python and you’re good to go!
